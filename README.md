This assignment is a precursor step to your final project. For this part of the assignment you must select your dataset and perform an initial train of a neural network. Submit a Python script or Jupyter notebook that demonstrates:

<ol>

 <li>Load your data set.</li>

 <li>Encode the feature vector (use zscores, dummy variables, etc).</li>

 <li>Train a neural network. You do not need to use validation at this point, but it is fine if you do. Tell me if you are performing classification or regression.</li>

 <li>Evaluate your neural network and display a statistic showing how good of a fit you got. This statistic will should be chosen based on if you are performing regression or classification. 5. The rest of the steps for the final project can be completed with the final project.</li>

 <li>This assignment gives me an opportunity to evaluate your choice of data set and initial approach.</li>
